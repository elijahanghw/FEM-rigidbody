# FEM-rigidbody

This repository contains .py scripts modelling a coupled torsion-bending beam attached to a rigid body. \\
pitching_heaving_2d.py - 2D mass with moment of inertia attached to a linear and torsional spring, mounted onto a rigid beam with external mass and moment of inertia. System is allowed to pitch and heave. \\
heaving_beam.py - Spanwise beam with external mass. System is allowed to heave. \\
pitching_beam.py - Spanwise torsional bar with external moment of inertia. System is allowed to pitch. \\
full_beam.py - Spanwise coupled torsion-bending beam with C.G. and external moment of inertia position away from the beam. System is allowed to pitch and heave.
